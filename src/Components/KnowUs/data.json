College, work ( even though we stay in different cities), or even life would not be the same without you. And I'd want it no other way. I shudder to think what'd happen when you'd go to the States. But I am fairly happy for you. And proud of you as always!"

Thanks for all the awesome memories and our never ending craziness, hostel life wouldn't have been half as much fun if it weren't for U, Pings and Nains... Thanks for creating my fb account, being my company for the late-night mess food, for introducing me to Suits and many more cool stuffs... I am so deeply inspired by you for all the hard-work and dedication u put into any task that u undertake... Thanks for teaching me the joy in sharing food (Can't believe u guys actually succeeded in doing that üòõ)... I hope all 4 of us get to reunite soon and relieve those carefree crazy days!!!\nWish u all the successes and happiness the world has to offer coz u my dear deserve the BEST!!   \nLove you and miss you sooo much chutkiii!! üíïüíï\nMuch louvee,\nPillu"
