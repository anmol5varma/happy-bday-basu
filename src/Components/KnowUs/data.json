I have always adored you like a kid and also looked upto you for inspiration several times. I miss our sleepovers, whether it is sata you and me or just you and me. Drunk nights, discussing politics and the world and men, with a tub of ice cream and bowl of of chips!  I wish we could do that more often. I love you, and I am so so proud of the person you were and are today. I wish you a lifetime of happiness and all the love and success. Happiest birthday littul girl, love you tons!❤️❤️"

Couldn't have hoped for a better partner in crime than you as kids.\nEven though 2020 seems to be not so great right now, we must remember that there is ALWAYS light at the end of the tunnel. So here is still hoping and praying that you have an amazing year (and HEALTHY). Love you 😘"

Thank you for always listening to everyone’s issues and being able to successfully tolerate some really shitty people. From overcoming ECE, guy problems, crazy internships and a lot more, I don’t think there could’ve been a better person I could think of doing all that with. Let’s just say the only reason why I regret not moving to Bangalore is you. I’m so proud of the person you’ve become and you deserve all the happiness in the world. \nLet’s just meet man. I have so much to tell you and do not ever forget your promise! \nLove Srish!"
